prodcon_sem README
kernel implementation in prodcon_sem/
user implementation in prodcon_sem/user

Both prodcon_sem and prodcon_mon were implemented concurrently, since outside of semaphores and monitors the two use the same basic logic.
Prodcon_sem implementation required knowledge of kernel semaphores, which took some time to implement.

Check the kernel README to see all references used.
